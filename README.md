# 🚀 Rohan's Digital Playground

Welcome to my portfolio - where code meets creativity and bugs fear to tread! This is where I showcase my projects that survived the `git commit --no-verify` of life.

## 🔥 Features That Don't Suck

- **Floating Head Mode**: My profile pic levitates because even my CSS needs attention
- **Social Links That Actually Work**: Unlike my sleep schedule
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices except Nokia 3310 (coming soon)
- **Color Scheme**: Stolen from a midnight coding session palette
- **Performance**: Faster than my motivation on Friday afternoons

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Because Recruiters Ask)

- **Frontend**: HTML5 (the OG), CSS3 (with dark magic), JavaScript (just enough to be dangerous)
- **Animations**: Powered by caffeine and willpower
- **Hosting**: Free tier (because "exposure" pays the bills, right?)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> "If it looks good in Chrome, it's production-ready"  
> *- Ancient Developer Proverb*

I followed these cutting-edge design principles:
1. Make it work
2. Make it pretty
3. If step 2 fails, add more glow effects

## 🚀 Installation (Because Apparently READMEs Need This)

```bash
# Clone this repository (if you want to steal my sweet animations)
git clone https://github.com/Web-Designer-Rohan/cool-portfolio.git

# Open in browser (requires a computer, surprisingly)
open index.html
